      <p>DaloRADIUS is an advanced RADIUS web platform aimed at managing Hotspots and general-purpose ISP deployments. It features rich user management, graphical reporting, accounting, and integrates with GoogleMaps for geo-locating (GIS). daloRADIUS is written in PHP and JavaScript and utilizes a database abstraction layer which means that it supports many database systems, among them the popular MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite, MsSQL, and many others.</br></br>

      It is based on a FreeRADIUS deployment with a database server serving as the backend. Among other features it implements ACLs, GoogleMaps integration for locating hotspots/access points visually and many more features. daloRADIUS is essentially a web application to manage a radius server so theoretically it can manage any radius server but specifically it manages FreeRADIUS and it's database structure. Since version 0.9-3 daloRADIUS has introduced an application-wide database abstraction layer based on PHP's PEAR::DB package which support a range of database servers.</p>
